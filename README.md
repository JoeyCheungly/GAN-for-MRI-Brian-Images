# GAN-for-MRI-Brian-Images
Author: Lok Yee Joey Cheung 

## Project Overview
This project leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate realistic MRI brain images. By training on a dataset of MRI slices, the model aims to produce high-quality, synthetic brain images that can potentially aid in medical imaging researches.
